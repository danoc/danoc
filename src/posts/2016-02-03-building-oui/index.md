I wrote the second part of a two-part series on CSS-Tricks about building and maintaining Optimizely's UI Library.

Here's the introduction:

> Over a year ago we set out on a mission at Optimizely to unify our product design and get a handle on our ever-increasing CSS payload. Fellow UI Engineer Tom Genoni spearheaded this effort in 2014 and created [our Sass framework called OUI](https://github.com/optimizely/oui).
>
> We first integrated OUI into a small part of the Optimizely application and gradually added it to the entire A/B Testing product in the months that followed. We have since developed an entire new product, and a handful of smaller ones, using the framework. This increase in scope presented unique challenges and required us to improve our implementation strategy.
>
> In Part 1, [Tom wrote about the high-level steps it took to build and evangelize OUI](https://css-tricks.com/optimizelys-ui-library-oui-1-of-2/). In this post I’ll discuss the Sass architecture decisions we made and processes we added that have allowed us to scale OUI.
