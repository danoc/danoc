My friend Eitan and I were expecting 20 people to attend last night's CS Internship Q&A. We got 130.

I'd like to thank the great student panelists and share some of their advice:

  1. **Work on side-projects, contribute to open source** \- When you're competing with thousands of students, the work you do outside of class will set you apart. All of our panelists have worked on side-projects and stressed their importance. Can't think of a project to work on? [Start contributing to open source software](http://opensource.com/life/13/4/ten-ways-participate-open-source). This is by far the most best advice.
  2. **Prepare for interviews** \- Brush up on algorithms, study data structures, and practice interview questions. Practice _does_ make perfect, and there's no shortage of books to help you. [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) is often a favorite.
  3. **Big company or startup?** \- Ideally, try to intern at one of each. Startups often give interns larger projects and teach you more about the inner workings of a company. Larger companies, on the other hand, will provide more structure and name recognition on a résumé.

These three points are only a few of the topics we touched on.
