export const metadata = {
  title: "Pipe Dream to-do list...",
  date: "2012-03-31T17:36:00-04:00",
};

I'm hoping to do most of these during spring break:

- <del>Create remaining author pages</del>
- Send author form to alumni
- Find missing articles in email
- Add co-authored posts to author post count
- <del>Let people search for authors</del>
- <del>Smart searches (Weekend Warriors, author names, etc...)</del>
- Redesign comment section
- Check if articles from Dec. 11, 2011 and Feb. 10, 2012 are missing
- Fix responsive design issues on homepage
- Redesign about, contact, and advertise pages
- Redesign bottom of articles and comments
- Check for missing meta data from archive articles
- Set up date archives
- Look into Edit Flow as a workflow management system
- Set up outgoing mail server
- Rework custom functions
- Work on Facebook timeline

Let's see how much I _actually_ get done...
