Follow Pipe Dream as we cover hurricane Sandy and its effects on Binghamton University. Any thoughts on the [live blogging platform](http://www.bupipedream.com/live/storm/)?

**Update** (Jan. 20, 2014): Unfortunately the link no longer works but the platform I built was the inspiration for [Beatstrap](http://beatstrap.me/), my latest project.
