This semester Pipe Dream received **159,276 visits** and **313,853 pageviews**. Nearly **25%** of these visits were on mobile devices and **32%** of visitors lived in Binghamton, Johnson City and Endicott.

**47%** of our traffic came from search engines while **33%** came from other websites (referral traffic). Facebook accounted for **23%** of our overall traffic.

Compared to the Fall 2010 semester, we received 19,000 more visits and 65,000 more pageviews. Two years ago, referral traffic made up only 25% of our traffic. Traffic from Facebook has more than doubled (37,000 visits this fall compared to 17,500 two years ago).
