I've designed the new Pipe Dream website in Photoshop and coded (most of it, at least) into a HTML/CSS layout that is [responsive](http://blog.danoc.me/2012/01/12/bupipedream-on-ipad.html), uses a [flexible grid](http://blog.danoc.me/2011/12/23/less-css-grid.html), and takes advantage of the latest frameworks and tools and such as the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) and [LESS](http://lesscss.org/).

Stage three is the creation of a WordPress theme and should be considerably more difficult. A lot has changed since I last developed for WordPress, so it's time to [read the manual](http://codex.wordpress.org/).

Throughout the next few weeks I'll be posting about the challenges I encounter and I'll be sharing some code along the way. I'd love to hear from anyone that has, or is, making the move from CollegePublisher to WordPress!
