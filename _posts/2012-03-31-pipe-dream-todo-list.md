I'm hoping to do most of these during spring break:

  * <del>Create remaining author pages</del>
  * Send author form to alumni
  * Find missing articles in email
  * Add co-authored posts to author post count
  * <del>Let people search for authors</del>
  * <del>Smart searches (Weekend Warriors, author names, etc...)</del>
  * Redesign comment section
  * Check if articles from Dec. 11, 2011 and Feb. 10, 2012 are missing
  * Fix responsive design issues on homepage
  * Redesign about, contact, and advertise pages
  * Redesign bottom of articles and comments
  * Check for missing meta data from archive articles
  * Set up date archives
  * Look into Edit Flow as a workflow management system
  * Set up outgoing mail server
  * Rework custom functions
  * Work on Facebook timeline

Let's see how much I _actually_ get done...
