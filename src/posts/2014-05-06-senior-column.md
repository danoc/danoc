It's a tradition at Pipe Dream, the student newspaper I worked at, that graduating staff write a senior column.

I shared college advice in my column: *[Make Your Own Future](http://www.bupipedream.com/opinion/35747/make-your-own-future/)*.

My final two cents: join relevant clubs, work on side projects and surround yourself with great people.
