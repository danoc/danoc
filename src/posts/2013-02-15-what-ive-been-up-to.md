It's been a while since I last posted here. Here's what I've been working on.

### Pipe Dream Redesign

Unfortunately the redesign is taking longer than excepted due to some complications. I decided to ditch the mobile-first approach since scaling up a complicated grid is easier said than done. The time spent making mockups wasn't wasted, however, since I have to ensure the mobile version lives up to the mockups.

Instead, I decided to create a [new branch in Git](https://github.com/bupipedream/Pipe-Dream/tree/redesign) and heavily refactor the existing design. The gigantic and poorly written CSS files have been causing headaches, but this [great talk by Andy Hume of the Guardian](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpFdyfs03Ug) has cleared some confusion.

I've got a lot going on in the next two weeks, so I've set a March 23 deadline to launch a redesigned Pipe Dream.

### Speaking at ACP Journalism Convention

I'm giving a talk about responsive web design at the [ACP Convention](http://www.studentpress.org/acp/conventions.html) at the end of February in San Francisco. Here's a look at the description:

> **Ditch the App, Go Responsive!**
>
> Apps seem to be all the rage, but do you really need an app? WordPress and other content management systems allow you to create a website that looks great on all devices. Learn to use media queries in CSS3 to “be mobile” and better serve your readers. For those attending this session, intermediate HTML and CSS knowledge is recommended.

I'm incredibly excited to do this and will post slides once they're ready.

### Faculty Salary Database

I always intended to work on side-projects for Pipe Dream. One of these is a database of faculty salaries at Binghamton University. The information is public and can easily be obtained with a FOIL request.

I worked on it over winter break with seven other developers to teach them about basic HTML/CSS, PHP, Git, and GitHub. The project is nearly completed but needs a few finishing touches. The source code [is availible on GitHub](https://github.com/bupipedream/Public-Salaries).

### Secret Project

I've been working on the early stages of a journalism startup I plan to launch next Fall. More details to come!

It's going to be a busy semester, but lots of exciting projects in the pipeline!
