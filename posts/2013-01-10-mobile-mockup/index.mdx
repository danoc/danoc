Spent the past day working on an HTML mockup of the [Pipe Dream redesign](/blog/pipe-dream-redesign/). While the [current design is responsive](/blog/from-college-publisher-to-wordpress/), I cut corners on the mobile version. The new website is being designed “mobile-first.” In other words, the website is designed for the mobile screen and only enhances as the browser size increases.

Edit: For comparison, take a look at the [old and new version side-by-side](https://www.dropbox.com/s/it4as8mz9kens6l/mobile-comparison.png).
