[Pipe Dream is now on GitHub](https://github.com/bupipedream/). To celebrate, we're releasing [WordPress Site Sync](https://github.com/bupipedream/WordPress-Site-Sync), a bash script that downloads the latest posts, uploads, and plugins from a WordPress site. The script imports the downloads into a local WordPress installation, ensuring you have the newest content before you hack away at your site's theme.

Take a look at the [repository page](https://github.com/bupipedream/WordPress-Site-Sync) for a detailed explanation. Tomorrow I'll be sharing a Capistrano recipe with a short post explaining how we use Git and Capistrano for deployment. Stay tuned!
